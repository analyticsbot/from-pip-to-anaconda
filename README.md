<p>This repository contains useful pip and conda commands for Python. It also contains the difference between them</p>

<p><strong>pip</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conda and pip are often considered as being nearly identical</li>
<li>designed and should be used for different purposes </li>
<li>Pip is the Python Packaging Authorityâ€™s recommended tool for 
installing packages from the Python Package Index, PyPI</li>
<li>Pip installs Python software packaged as wheels or source 
distributions</li>
<li>When installing packages, pip installs dependencies in a recursive, serial loop. </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<strong>Conda</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conda is a cross platform package and environment manager </li>
<li>Used to install and manage conda packages from the Anaconda 
repository as well as from the Anaconda Cloud</li>
<li>Conda packages are binaries. </li>
<li>Additionally conda packages are not limited to 
Python software. They may also contain C or C++ libraries, 
R packages or any other software.</li>
<li>conda uses a satisfiability (SAT) solver to verify that all requirements of all packages installed in an environment are met. This check can take extra time but helps prevent the creation of broken environments.</li>
</ul>
